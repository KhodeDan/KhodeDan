Hi it's me Jason, from discord.
I wanted to apologise for not responding
to your messages. I was just freaked
out by your confession, I went in a
spiral because we were good friends
and then it got ruined. Anyway I still
had the link you sent me on Discord.
So that's how I was able to reach you.
I don't mind to be friends with you, but
nothing beyond that. That is if you still
want to be friends. If things get out of hand
then I'm out. let me know
